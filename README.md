The code in this repository requires the `th-new` branch of GHC. Instructions for building this branch are available on the [GHC wiki](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/TemplateHaskell/Typed#Compilingtheth-newbranch). Be sure to follow the instructions for building a static GHCi, as that is required for runtime compilation using the GHC API due to [bug #7774](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7774). You will also need to install the [`ghc-paths` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-paths-0.1.0.9) by hand.
